pyATS Ping Tests
=====================================
Get Started with Test-Driven Automation using reachability tests with pyATS PING Parser and testing

This code has examples of hard coded IP address PING reachability tests including success rate (100%), minimum, maximum, and average millisecond response time.

This code also has examples of using CDP neighbor address PING reachability tests including success rate (100%), minimum, maximum, and average millisecond response time.

This code works with the DevNet Cisco Modeling Labs Enterprise Sandbox (see README for instructions to enable CDP on all 4 devices).
